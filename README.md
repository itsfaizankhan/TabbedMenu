## Column View Navigation Menu using Textual

This project demonstrates a simple column view navigation menu for terminal user interfaces (TUI) using the (Textual)[https://github.com/textualize/textual/] framework written in Python. I am learning Textual while developing this project, and the aim is to create a base for future menu-driven TUI applications.
