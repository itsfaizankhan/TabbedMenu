## Column View Navigation Menu using Textual

This project demonstrates a simple column view navigation menu for terminal user interfaces (TUI) using the [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/) framework written in Python. I am learning Textual while developing this project, and the aim is to create a base for future menu-driven TUI applications.

## Dependencies

- [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/)

## TODO

- [x] Focus on sub-menu when selecting an option in sidebar
- [ ] Keep the option in sidebar highlighted when selecting and "auto-focusing" on submenu. After that, make sure the highlight colour of focused option is not same as the sidebar option.
